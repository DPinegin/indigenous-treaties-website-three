        <h3>Unfulfilled Promises</h3>
        <p>
          After the signing of Treaty One, many outside promises on the side of
          the Canadian government were not fulfilled. No provisions were
          included for agricultural implements, clothing and animals that were
          promised. Many Indigenous People voiced their concerns about the
          unfulfilled promises in February 1872, yet the issues were not
          resolved by the federal government until April 30th, 1975.

      <section>
        <h3>Broken Promises: Hunting and Fishing Rights</h3>
        <p>
          The negotiators from the side of the Canadian government failed to
          include a provision on hunting and fishing rights in the written text
          of Treaty One, although they verbally promised to Indigenous Peoples
          that they would retain such rights in the ceded territory. As the
          years went on, the settler government of Manitoba began restricting
          access to Indigenous Peoples to game and fishing, which violated these
          promises.

        <h3>Implementation of Treaty One Today</h3>
        <p>
          Treaty One established clearly defined land ownership and
          jurisdiction, and foster a new relationship based on mutual respect,
          trust and understanding. In addition, it provides guidelines on how
          Europeans can use the traditional land that Indigenous Peoples have
          occupied. They also provide documents with Indigenous rights as
          written in the treaties. Although there are many instances of conflict
          due to the unfulfilled promises historically, today Treaty One is
          still implemented in many ways. One of those ways is by building
          reserves, most notably the plans for a Naawi-Oodena urban reserve,
          also known as Former Kapyong Barracks Master Plan.

      <section>
        <h3>The Naawi-Oodena Master Plan</h3>
        <p>
          The Naawi-Oodena Master Plan oversees the development of former
          Kapyong Barracks into an urban reserve for Treaty One First Nations,
          Winnipeg, Manitoba and Canada for future generations. The development
          of the lands will help shape Winnipeg’s future urban growth, generate
          significant economic investment and connect communities. The
          comprehensive planning and framework of the Master Plan wants to
          transform the 160-acres site into a diverse mixed-use community,
          emphasizing Indigenous culture, design-excellence and connectivity
          with the surrounding neighborhoods.
