      /*
        This is a researched transition that was sourced from https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/.
        The following styles the element with the id "travel-manitoba-link" to have:
        - a linear gradient as the background of the section that will be rotated 160 degrees clockwise, with two colors fading into each-other: one is 
        #c4f9f3, which is the secondary color, and the other is #e1fbff, which is a lighter version of the secondary color. Prefixes are 
        added to make sure that the property will be compatible with different browsers. For example, the -webkit-
        makes this show up on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and modern versions of Opera. -moz- makes 
        this show up on Mozilla Firefox, while -o- makes this show up on old versions of Opera. 
        - To have no border around the content.
        - To have padding (space between the inner content and the edges of the content) to be 2% of the container.
        - To have a font color of #323140, which is a dark gray with a hint of blue
        - The font size of 5.5 times the root element's font size
        - To align the text to the center of the container.
        - To diplay the element as inline block, meaning it can be displayed beside other elements.
        - To not have any text-decorations (liek underlines).
        - A transition that will move the the element (transform), and that will last for 250 miliseconds. 
        Compatability prefixes are added to make sure that the property will be compatible with different 
        browsers. For example, the -webkit- makes this show up on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and 
        modern versions of Opera. -moz- makes this show up on Mozilla Firefox, while -o- makes this show up 
        on old versions of Opera. 
        - A position of relative, meaning that the element will be positioned relative to its default (static)
        position, unless you start changing the CSS properties for top, right, bottom, and left (Scott Hardman).
        - To have a font-weight (the thickness of the font's strokes/lines) of bolder (defines very thick characters).
